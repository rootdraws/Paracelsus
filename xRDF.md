# MOLOCH RDF

The use of Manifold on Base opens up the integration of Moloch RDF.

The foundation of this meaning is that the DAO gets to manage the launchpad.

You are basically making a meme token launchpad, which is controlled by a moloch RDF DAO, and each time you buy into a launch, you get a share, in the form of an NFT.

## CONTROL VARIABLES

Which varialbes which are currently hardset, would then be controlled by this Moloch DAO?

## DAO OWNED SUDO LP

DAO owned LP can mean Sudoswap LP for the NFTs.

## ManaPool

ManaPool and the Undine are designed to be external, and beyond control. However, the ManaPool could Fund the DAO Treasury.

## DAO TREASURY FUNDING

1) Public Goods Development
2) Art Collections to be WL for Launch

By pulling off ETH from the ManaPool and giving it to the community treasury, you create a weekly growing NON RQ pot of ETH which could be paid out to artists.

The petitions and processes are public, which means that there is time for building anticipation, and also bounty for attracting more and higher quality artists over time.

## ALL MEME TOKENS?

The types of projects that are launched are also variable, meaning the launchpad can also be used to launch the new DeFi Projects, or a fork with a slight modification could be released in parallel, which would facilitate LP Fundraising with MOLOCH RDF, using the same campaign platform.

So, we are building a DAO Owned Launchpad, which fair launches NFTs | Tokens | LP, and then raises ETH Bounties each week from the token launches, which provide ETH in the treasury for artists, as well as public goods funding, as well as increasing LP held by Undines.

## NEW ARTISTS | PROJECTS

As projects are interested in using the launchpad, they will need to be artist led, and grassroots fair launched.

## DAO Controlled ManaPool

The DAO will control ManaPool voting weights, but not through Moloch Structures, but through the veNFT weekly stake voting system -- similar to velodrome.

These Vote Weights will add value to projects, or penalize projects that underperform, or are worthy of contempt.
