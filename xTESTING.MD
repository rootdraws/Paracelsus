## PREP

[AUTOMATION REGISTERED](https://automation.chain.link/sepolia)

/*

Another issue here, is that the "deployer wallet" needs to be the one who funds and increases funding for these chainlink automation accounts.

This means that there will need to be a Multisig | Moloch DAO that receives LINK tokens via the distillation process, and then the Automation Registry needs to be created with that deployer acct.

This would probably be a good time to start thinking about how to use Gnosis Defender in order to deploy contracts, and how you would set those up with a Gnosis Safe Module.

## ARCHIVIST

/*

There should be more clear ways to Query all of the information avaialble in the Archivist, even a singular function that shares multiple variables. 
Something like this would be useful for testing, and would test multiple read functions at the same time.

*/

### Constructor Archivist

- **setArchivistAddressBook(address _uniV2Router, address _paracelsus, address _manaPool)**: Sets the addresses for related contracts (router, paracelsus, and mana pool).

- **resetDistillationFlag()**: Resets the distillation flag to false.
- **checkUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Checks if upkeep is needed, specifically checking the distillation flag.
- **performUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Performs upkeep by calling the distillation function in the ManaPool, resets the distillation flag, and closes the current campaign.

### Events

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## ManaPool

### Constructor ManaPool

- **setManaPoolAddressBook(address _uniV2Router, address _paracelsus, address _archivist)**: Sets necessary addresses for interacting with other contracts.

### ETH Management

- **deposit()**: Allows the contract to receive ETH deposits directly to its address.

### Claims Management

- **claimTokens()**: Allows users to claim their tokens based on the Archivistâ€™s records. This function checks for valid claims and ensures claims can only be made within the specified time frame. It also interacts with the `Archivist` to reset claim amounts.

### Token and ETH Balances

- **currentBalance()**: Returns the current ETH balance of the `ManaPool`.

### Distillation Process

- **distillation()**: Handles the selling of a specified percentage of each ERC-20 token held by the contract for ETH. This function is intended to be called periodically through automation and uses the Uniswap V2 Router to perform the market sell.

### Automation Functions

- **checkUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Checks if the conditions for performing upkeep are met, specifically if the time has passed for claims to close.
- **performUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Performs the necessary upkeep actions. This includes closing claims, calculating rewards, and setting the distillation flag.

### Event Logging

- **ClaimsClosed(address indexed undineAddress)**: Emitted when claims for a specific campaign are closed.
- **TokensClaimed(address indexed undineAddress, uint256 amount)**: Emitted when tokens are successfully claimed by a user.

This contract serves as an essential part of a decentralized ecosystem, managing the distribution and conversion of tokens to ensure liquidity and reward mechanisms function as intended.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Paracelsus

### Constructor Paracelsus

- **constructor(address _uniV2Router, address _archivist, address _manaPool, address _tributary)**: Initializes the contract and sets up necessary addresses for other components like the router, archivist, mana pool, and tributary.

### Campaign Management Paracelsus

- **createCampaign(string memory tokenName, string memory tokenSymbol)**: Launches a new `Undine` token campaign, registers it with the `Archivist`, and initializes campaign data.

/*

Create an endTime variable here for launches, and an endClaim variable for end of claim. Then, modify the Archivist to receive these values, and create functions in the archivist to call those values.

This way we could tell in advance when the time is up -- and if the variables exist, then, we could probably call them from the frontend.

*/

### Automation and Upkeep

- **checkUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Checks if the conditions for performing upkeep are met, specifically whether it has been 24 hours since the campaign creation without liquidity pairing.
- **performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData)**: Performs the necessary upkeep actions, which include invoking liquidity pairing, updating archival records, and closing the campaign.

### Events Paracelsus

- **UndineDeployed(address indexed undineAddress, string tokenName, string tokenSymbol)**: Emitted when a new `Undine` campaign is successfully launched.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## TRIBUTARY

### Configuration and Address Setting

- **setTributaryAddressBook(address _archivist, address _manaPool)**: Configures the contract with external addresses for the `Archivist` and `ManaPool`. This ensures that `Tributary` can interact with other parts of the system.

### Contribution Handling

- **tribute(uint256 amount)**: Allows contributors to send ETH to the campaign within a 24-hour window after its launch. It records contributions in the `Archivist` and triggers related events.

### Automation and Upkeep | TRIBUTARY

- **checkUpkeep(bytes calldata)**: Checks if there is an unprocessed campaign that has been closed but not yet processed for claims. This function is part of the automation interface to determine if the contract needs to perform upkeep.
- **performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData)**: Processes claims for a campaign once it is determined that upkeep is needed. This function calculates the claim amounts for each contributor based on the data in the `Archivist`.

### Events Tributary

- **TributeMade(address indexed undineAddress, address indexed contributor, uint256 amount)**: Emitted when a contribution is made to a campaign, providing transparency and traceability of contributions.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## UNDINE

/*

 An Issue with the Undines, is that the factory contract which creates new campaigns requires the Undines to register their Automation after deployment.
 This is not possible, because we need to do this without maintenance.

We can test the logic of these functions, but we would need to export them to another area.

*/

### Constructor | UNDINE

- **constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, address _uniV2Router, address _paracelsus, address _archivist, address _manaPool)**: Initializes the contract with token details, Uniswap router, and addresses for related contracts such as Paracelsus, Archivist, and ManaPool. It also mints the initial supply of tokens.

### Token Management

- **deposit() external payable**: Allows the contract to receive ETH directly from transactions.

### Liquidity Operations

- **invokeLiquidityPair() external**: Adds liquidity to a Uniswap pool using all ETH and ERC20 tokens held by the contract, setting up an LP token and updating relevant state variables.

### Automation and Upkeep | UNDINE

- **checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)**: Checks if there is a need to perform upkeep, specifically looking if the contract balance is above zero and an LP token address is set.
- **performUpkeep(bytes calldata) external override**: Performs the actual upkeep which includes swapping ETH for tokens and adding liquidity to Uniswap, effectively reinvesting into the liquidity pool.

### Events | UNDINE

- **LPPairInvoked(address indexed undineAddress, address lpTokenAddress)**: Emitted after liquidity is added to a Uniswap pool, indicating the operation was successful and providing the new LP token address.
- **LPCompounded(address indexed undineAddress, address lpTokenAddress)**: Emitted after liquidity is compounded within the Uniswap pool, indicating that the reinvestment was successful.
